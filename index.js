// Now let's bring in the power of NPM (Node Package Manager), a platform where people publish Node packages, which are bundles of software that you can use NPM to import into and use in your own projects. We'll use the `chalk` module to make our console.log messages a little more snazzy! ðŸ’…ðŸŒˆâœ¨

// ðŸ‘‰ 4a. We've already initialised our project folder as an NPM project. That means we can use node modules other people have created in our project... Sweet. Makes this task easy ðŸ™‚

// ðŸ‘‰ 4b. Use the [chalk docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) to find out how to install `chalk` to your project (check your dependencies in your `package.json` file if you want to check that you've installed it correctly). Follow the docs to see how you can now use chalk in `index.js`.

// ðŸ‘‰ 4c. Use `chalk` to do the following in your console.logs within `describeItem`:

// - Make the name of each item in your collection cyan
// - Make the count of each item in your collection yellow
// - Make what you like about each item in your collection green
